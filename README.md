## My process

The process isn't clear cause I've freshly finish a tutorial and but thanks to [freecodecamp](https://freecodecamp.org) I know where to start. But it's basically something similar to this
  - HTML : The skeleton
  - CSS : I've taken care of the desktop view first and adding the media queries at the end

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- For styles

### What I learned

I've more in this project than I can tell. I think now I understand when people say that it's in projects that you learn more

* For example about media queries 

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 1024px) {
	main {
		width: 27%;
	}
}
```

* And some landmarks

```html
<main class="qr-code">
					<img alt="qr-code" src="images/image-qr-code.png"/>
					<div id="text">
						<h1>Improve your front-end skills by building  project</h1>
					<p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level.</p>
					</div>
		</main>
		<section class="attribution-section">
			<div class="attribution">
				Challenge by <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io?ref=challenge" target="_blank">Frontend Mentor</a>. 
				Coded by <a href="#">The wild man</a>.
			</div>
		</section>
</main>
```


### Continued development

I think one of the areas I need to improve is the responsive part


### Useful resources

- [W3SCHOOLS](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me for CSS and HTML documentation. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
